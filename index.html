            <h2 id="post2_title">Why should anyone learn Python?</h2>
            <img src="images/index/python_logo.png" alt="Python logo" width="450" height="200">
            <p>Python is an interpreted programming language that was first introduced 30 years ago in 1990. 
            The language itself is well-suited for the development of both large and small software 
            implementations. The most popular paradigm of Python programming is done in the context of 
            object oriented programming. Python also supports other programming paradigms like structured 
            programming, functional programming, and aspect-oriented programming. Python is praised for its 
            readability, as the language's simple syntax is quickly comprehended, even by new programmers. 
            Many find Python to be easier to learn compared to other modern programming languages, as using 
            Python's friendly syntax and formatting is both rewarding and satisfying. The language itself is 
            dynamically typed, meaning it is more forgiving and follows a looser writing structure compared to 
            other languages. Python also manages its memory automatically, a complicated feature that many 
            programming languages leave to the programmer for figuring out. Python's development community is 
            enormous. The internet is filled with support for popular problems and implementations. The 
            community is constantly developing plugins and libraries to expand the usefulness of Python. 
            Finally, Python programmers are in high demand in recent times. High-level python programmers 
            should have a semi-easy time finding jobs in today's market, especially now that AI 
            implementations are becoming increasingly popular.</p>

            <h2 id="post1_title">Everything wrong with C++</h2>
            
            <img src="images/index/c++logo.png" alt="C++ logo" width="400" height="200">
            <P> C++ is an all-purpose programming language that was first released in 1985. The language itself 
            is most well-suited for system programming with an emphasis on efficiency and the management of 
            large structures. C++ programs are usually composed of multiple header and implementation files 
            that implement and describe the many user-defined classes that are inherent in C++ software design. 
            To start off, C++ is built upon the frameworks of the low level programming language C. While both 
            languages are versatile, high-level implementations in C++ are reliant upon the abstractions of its 
            lower level foundations. This means that creating custom classes and programs is often met with the 
            masking of the inherent lower-level annoyances. Front-end oriented libraries and plugins are difficult 
            to use due to the back-end oriented syntax and trivialities. This makes abstracting one's own classes 
            much more difficult, as the programmer cannot forget to encapsulate the low-level functionalities that 
            make the language tick. C++ also does not support automatic garbage collection the way other languages 
            do. This is a major headache for developers as it makes their code much more vulnerable memory leaks, 
            or instances in which the program's data stays allocated in the system's memory after a program has 
            been executed. Having to program one's own garbage collection is especially challenging to new C++ 
            developers, making it incredibly difficult to learn. In addition to lacking garbage collection, C++ 
            is also strictly typed, allowing for far less wiggle room compared to dynamically typed languages 
            like Python. This is another reason why C++ is unfriendly to new users.
